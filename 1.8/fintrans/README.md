# Fast Data: Financial Transaction Processing

This demo is all about processing, monitoring and understanding high-volume financial transactions. There are several challenges that we tackle here: 1. the frequency of transaction, 2. the volume of transaction, 3. scaling. 

For the sake of this demo let's assume you're responsible for building a data processing infrastructure that allows insights about recent transactions from multiple locations (with recent being, for example, the past hour) as well as being able to spot fraudulent transactions, for example such that violate money laundering regulations. In the context of money laundering, what happens is that a large amount, say $1,000,000 is split into many small batches, each just under the allowed value of, for example, $10,000. With many tens or hundreds thousands of transactions going on at any given point in time it's hard to keep a running total for each account in real time and react appropriately. Failure to report or react on attempted money laundering typically means fines for the financial institutionsâ€”something best avoided altogether. See also [US](https://www.fincen.gov/history-anti-money-laundering-laws) and [EU](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015L0849) legislation and regulations on this topic for more information.

## Architecture

![Financial transaction processing demo architecture](img/fintrans-architecture.png)

## Prerequisites

- A running [DC/OS 1.8.7](https://dcos.io/releases/1.8.7/) or higher cluster with at least 2 private agents each with 2 CPUs and 5 GB of RAM available as well as the [DC/OS CLI](https://dcos.io/docs/1.8/usage/cli/install/) installed in version 0.14 or higher.
- The [dcos/demo](https://github.com/dcos/demos/) Git repo must be available locally, use: `git clone https://github.com/dcos/demos.git` if you haven't done so, yet.
- The JSON query util [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/Installation) must be installed.
- [SSH](https://dcos.io/docs/1.8/administration/access-node/sshcluster/) cluster access must be set up.

Going forward we'll call the directory you cloned the `dcos/demo` Git repo into `$DEMO_HOME`.

The DC/OS services and support libraries used in the demo are as follows:

- Apache Kafka 0.10.0 with Shopify's [sarama](https://godoc.org/github.com/Shopify/sarama) package, client-side.
- InfluxDB 0.13.0 with [influxdata v2](https://godoc.org/github.com/influxdata/influxdb/client/v2) package, client-side.
- Grafana v3.1.1

## Install

After either single command install or manual install method your DC/OS UI should look as follows:

![All services of the fintrans demo in the DC/OS UI](img/services-list.png)

### Single command

If you want to install the demo with a single command, use:

```bash
$ cd $DEMO_HOME
$ ./install-all.sh
```

Now you can jump to ...

### Manual

If you want to install the demo manually here are the required services that you'd need to set up.

#### InfluxDB

Install InfluxDB with the following [options](influx-ingest/influx-config.json):

```bash
$ cd $DEMO_HOME/1.8/fintrans/influx-ingest/
$ dcos package install --options=influx-config.json influxdb
```

#### Grafana

Install Marathon-LB and Grafana (the latter uses the former to be accessible from outside the cluster):

```bash
$ dcos package install marathon-lb
$ dcos package install grafana

```

The Grafana dashboard is available on `$PUBLIC_AGENT_IP:13000`, and if you don't know `$PUBLIC_AGENT_IP` yet, [find it out first](https://dcos.io/docs/1.8/administration/locate-public-agent/). Log in with: `admin`/`admin`.

Next, we set up InfluxDB as a data source in Grafana, effectively connecting Grafana to InfluxDB. Use the following values:

- In the `Http settings` section:
 - Url value: `http://influxdb.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:8086`
 - User value: `root`
 - Password value: `root` 
- In the `InfluxDB Details` section:
 - Database value: `fintrans` 
 - Leave User/Password fields here empty

The result should look as follows (note the `Success` message after you hit the `Save & Test` button):

![Configuring InfluxDB as Grafana data source](img/influx-ds-in-grafana.png)

#### Kafka

Install the Apache Kafka package with the following [options](kafka-config.json):

```bash
$ cd $DEMO_HOME/1.8/fintrans/
$ dcos package install kafka --options=kafka-config.json
```

Note that if you are unfamiliar with Kafka and its terminology, you can check out the respective [101 example](https://github.com/dcos/examples/tree/master/1.8/kafka) as well now.

Next, figure out where the broker is:

```bash
$ dcos kafka connection

{
  "address": [
    "10.0.3.178:9398"
  ],
  "zookeeper": "master.mesos:2181/dcos-service-kafka",
  "dns": [
    "broker-0.kafka.mesos:9398"
  ],
  "vip": "broker.kafka.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:9092"
}
```

Note the FQDN for the broker, in our case `broker-0.kafka.mesos:9398`, you will need it if you want to do local [development and testing](#development).

### Generator and consumers

Last but not least it's time to launch the financial transaction generator and the consumers:

```bash
$ cd $DEMO_HOME/1.8/fintrans/
$ ./install-services.sh
deploying the fintrans generator ...
Created deployment 56d3e77d-08e6-4a43-87cd-bcc6a107e8c3
==========================================================================
deploying the recent financial transactions consumer ...
Created deployment 78440e10-17e0-4046-b22d-d60fd388ffad
==========================================================================
deploying the money laundering detector ...
Created deployment 7e2cd878-d651-4cb2-bf87-7d25799758a3
DONE ====================================================================
```

Now, since we have all components, that is, Kafka, InfluxDB, Grafana, the fintrans generator and the two consumer services installed, we are ready to use the demo.

## Use

The following sections describe how to use the demo after having installed it.

### Generating transactions

In order to do something with the transactions we first need to generate them. If you have installed the demo (either with the [single command](#single-command) or the [manual](#manual) method) there is no further action required from your side and you can continue with [consuming transactions](#consuming-transactions). If you want to do local testing and development, jump to the [respective section](#development) and continue there.

A quick note concerning how transactions are represented on a logical level. We are using the following format:

```
source_account target_account amount
```

For example, `396 465 6789` means that $6789 have been transferred from account no `396` to `465`.

It's the job of the [generator](generator/) to produce a stream of random financial transactions. The generator itself is stateless and ingests the transactions into Kafka, organized by city. That is, the city the transaction originated in is represented by a Kafka topic. The five cities used are:

    London
    NYC
    SF
    Moscow
    Tokyo


Note that if you want to reset the topics, that is remove all messages for a certain topic (= city) stored in Kafka, you can do a `dcos kafka topic list` and `dcos kafka topic delete XXX` with `XXX` being one of the listed topics (cities).

### Consuming transactions

The core piece of this demo is consuming the financial transactions in some meaningful way. We provide two consumers here but you're encouraged to add others that aggregate data or act on certain patterns.

#### Recent transactions dashboard

One consumer of the transactions we stored in Kafka is a combination of InfluxDB and Grafana, called the [influx-ingest](influx-ingest/) consumer.
This consumer uses Grafana as the visual frontend, showing a breakdown of average and total transaction volume per city for the past hour. 

Now, to see the recent financial transaction streaming in, locate the Grafana dashboard at `$PUBLIC_AGENT_IP:13000` (note: you might need to [find out the IP of the public agent](https://dcos.io/docs/1.8/administration/locate-public-agent/ first) and log in with: `admin`/`admin`. Next, load the prepared [Grafana dashboard](influx-ingest/grafana-dashboard.json) and you should see something like this:

![Transactions in Grafana](img/grafana-dashboard.png)

Feel free to change the Grafana graphs or add new ones, at this stage.

#### Money laundering detector

Another consumer of the transactions stored in Kafka is the money [laundering detector](laundering-detector/). It is a command line tool that alerts when the aggregate transaction volume from a source to a target account hits a certain (configurable) treshold. 

Now, in order to highlight potential money laundering attempts to a human operator who then has to verify manually if indeed a fraudulent transaction has been taken place.

In order to see the  money laundering alerts, locate the money laundering detector in the DC/OS UI. Look for a service with an ID of `/fintrans/laundering-detector` and go to the `Logs` tab:

![Accessing the money laundering detector in the DC/OS UI](img/laundering-detector.png)

Alternatively, from the command line, you can see the logs as follows: 1. Find out the task ID of the money laundering detector with `dcos task` and then use `dcos task log --follow $TASKID` to view the logs:

```bash
$ dcos task

```

Note that the alert treshold by default is set to $8000 but you can change that at any time by editing the [service definition](service/laundering-detector.json).

## Development

### Tunneling 

For local development and testing we use [DC/OS tunneling](https://dcos.io/docs/1.8/administration/access-node/tunnel/) to make the nodes directly accessible on the development machine. The following instructions are only an example (using Tunnelblick on macOS) and the concrete steps necessary depend on your platform as well as on what VPN client you're using.

```bash
$ sudo dcos tunnel vpn --client=/Applications/Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources/openvpn/openvpn-2.3.12/openvpn
Password:
*** Unknown ssh-rsa host key for 35.156.70.254: 13ec7cde1d3967d2371eb375f48c4690

ATTENTION: IF DNS DOESN'T WORK, add these DNS servers!
198.51.100.1
198.51.100.2
198.51.100.3

Waiting for VPN server in container 'openvpn-6nps1efm' to come up...

VPN server output at /tmp/tmpn34d7n0d
VPN client output at /tmp/tmpw6aq3v4z
```

Note that it is necessary to [add the announced DNS servers]( https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18499?locale=en_US) as told by Tunnelblick, and make sure the are they appear at the top of the list, before any other DNS server entries.

### Generating and consuming transactions

For a local dev/test setup, and with [DC/OS VPN tunnel](#tunneling) enabled, we can run the fintrans generator as follows:

```bash
$ cd $DEMO_HOME/1.8/fintrans/generator/
$ go build
$ ./generator --broker broker-0.kafka.mesos:9398
INFO[0001] &sarama.ProducerMessage{Topic:"London", Key:sarama.Encoder(nil), Value:"678 816 2957", Metadata:interface {}(nil), Offset:10, Partition:0, Timestamp:time.Time{sec:0, nsec:0, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)}, retries:0, flags:0}
INFO[0003] &sarama.ProducerMessage{Topic:"SF", Key:sarama.Encoder(nil), Value:"762 543 6395", Metadata:interface {}(nil), Offset:4, Partition:0, Timestamp:time.Time{sec:0, nsec:0, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)}, retries:0, flags:0}
INFO[0005] &sarama.ProducerMessage{Topic:"London", Key:sarama.Encoder(nil), Value:"680 840 8115", Metadata:interface {}(nil), Offset:11, Partition:0, Timestamp:time.Time{sec:0, nsec:0, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)}, retries:0, flags:0}
^C
```

Again, assuming [DC/OS VPN tunnel](#tunneling) is enabled, you can run the recent transactions dashboard (feeding InfluxDB/Grafana) from your local development machine as follows. First, you need to find out the InfluxDB API URL and provide it via the environment variable `INFLUX_API` (in our case, looking up where the InfluxDB instance runs, using the higher of the two ports, the URL is `http://10.0.3.178:11973`):

```bash
$ cd $DEMO_HOME/1.8/fintrans/influx-ingest/
$ go build
$ INFLUX_API=http://10.0.3.178:11973 ./influx-ingest --broker broker-0.kafka.mesos:9398
INFO[0003] Got main.Transaction{City:"Tokyo", Source:"836", Target:"378", Amount:1211}  func=consume
INFO[0003] Connected to &client.client{url:url.URL{Scheme:"http", Opaque:"", User:(*url.Userinfo)(nil), Host:"10.0.3.178:11973", Path:"", RawPath:"", RawQuery:"", Fragment:""}, username:"root", password:"root", useragent:"InfluxDBClient", httpClient:(*http.Client)(0xc82000bb30), transport:(*http.Transport)(0xc8200d00c0)}  func=consume
INFO[0003] Preparing batch &client.batchpoints{points:[]*client.Point(nil), database:"fintrans", precision:"s", retentionPolicy:"", writeConsistency:""}  func=consume
INFO[0003] Added point &client.Point{pt:(*models.point)(0xc8200839e0)}  func=consume
INFO[0003] Ingested &client.batchpoints{points:[]*client.Point{(*client.Point)(0xc82000f9f0)}, database:"fintrans", precision:"s", retentionPolicy:"", writeConsistency:""}  func=ingest2Influx
^C
```

You can launch the money laundering detector as follows from your local development machine (note: [DC/OS VPN tunnel](#tunneling) must be enabled):

```bash
$ cd $DEMO_HOME/1.8/fintrans/laundering-detector/
$ go build
$ ALERT_THRESHOLD=6000 ./laundering-detector --broker broker-0.kafka.mesos:9398
INFO[0002] Queued main.Transaction{City:"SF", Source:"970", Target:"477", Amount:1102}  func=consume
INFO[0002] Dequeued main.Transaction{City:"SF", Source:"970", Target:"477", Amount:1102}  func=detect
INFO[0002] 970 -> 477 totalling 1102 now                 func=detect
INFO[0002] Current queue length: 0                       func=detect
INFO[0004] Queued main.Transaction{City:"London", Source:"236", Target:"367", Amount:9128}  func=consume
INFO[0004] Dequeued main.Transaction{City:"London", Source:"236", Target:"367", Amount:9128}  func=detect
INFO[0004] 236 -> 367 totalling 9128 now                 func=detect
POTENTIAL MONEY LAUNDERING: 236 -> 367 totalling 9128 now
^C
``` 

Note that if you're only interested in the money laundering alerts themselves you can execute it as follows, effectively hiding all the `INFO` messages:

```bash
$ ALERT_THRESHOLD=6000 ./laundering-detector --broker broker-0.kafka.mesos:9398 2>/dev/null
POTENTIAL MONEY LAUNDERING: 292 -> 693 totalling 7104 now
POTENTIAL MONEY LAUNDERING: 314 -> 666 totalling 6613 now
^C
```
